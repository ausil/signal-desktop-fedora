# signal-desktop-fedora

Some experiments with the SPEC file to create an RPM for fedora - basically about the patching of the source.

The source of signal-desktop are here: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop

SPEC file inspired by: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/luminoso/Signal-Desktop/

Mainly the discussion between inline patches in the SPEC file or having them outsourced to patch files
